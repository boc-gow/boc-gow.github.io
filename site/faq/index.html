      <dt>Why is Discord essential?</dt>
      <dd>
        We use Discord to share knowledge, team and troop tips, event
        information, advice on gameplay and important guild news.
      </dd>
      <dt>What is expected of guild members?</dt>
      <dd>
        <a href="/reqs">Weekly requirements are here.</a>
        We expect the minimum gold donation to be made on day one. The other
        minimums can be achieved over the rest of the week. All players should
        start the weekly guild events by no later than the end of day 2.
      </dd>
      <dt>Can I opt out of events?</dt>
      <dd>No, all guild members are expected to take part in all guild events</dd>
      <dt>
        Sometimes I may be able to play as much as I like due to real life stuff
        (work pressures, being away/offline, ...), will I be kicked out of the
        guild?
      </dt>
      <dd>
        No. Real Life always takes precedence so just speak to one of The
        Reapers so they are aware of your situation. Or just leave a message in
        the dedicated channel on our Discord server.
      </dd>
      <dt>Who are The Reapers?</dt>
      <dd>Experienced players who help the Guild Leader run the guild.</dd>
      <dt>How do you move up through the ranks in the guild?</dt>
      <dd>
        Members are promoted if they consistently exceed the targets set for
        their level. Being active on Discord, talking about the game and sharing
        teams and so on is also taken into account.
